### Color Scheme

Wezterm ships with the full set of over 200 color schemes available from
[iterm2colorschemes.com](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/).  You can select a
color scheme with a line like this:

```toml
color_scheme = "Batman"
```

There are literally too many schemes to reasonably list here; check out the
screenshots on [iterm2colorschemes.com](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/)!

The `color_scheme` option takes precedence over the `colors` section below.

### Defining your own colors

Rather than using a color scheme, you can specify the color palette using the
`[colors]` configuration section.  Note that `color_scheme` takes precedence
over this section.

You can configure colors with a section like this.  In addition to specifying
[SVG/CSS3 color names](https://docs.rs/palette/0.4.1/palette/named/index.html#constants),
you can use `#RRGGBB` to specify a color code using the
usual hex notation; eg: `#000000` is equivalent to `black`:

```toml
[colors]
# The default text color
foreground = "silver"
# The default background color
background = "black"

# Overrides the cell background color when the current cell is occupied by the
# cursor and the cursor style is set to Block
cursor_bg = "#52ad70"
# Overrides the text color when the current cell is occupied by the cursor
cursor_fg = "black"
# Specifies the border color of the cursor when the cursor style is set to Block,
# of the color of the vertical or horizontal bar when the cursor style is set to
# Bar or Underline.
cursor_border = "#52ad70"

# The color of the scrollbar "thumb"; the portion that represents the current viewport
scrollbar_thumb = "#222222"

ansi = ["black", "maroon", "green", "olive", "navy", "purple", "teal", "silver"]
brights = ["grey", "red", "lime", "yellow", "blue", "fuchsia", "aqua", "white"]
```

### Defining a Color Scheme in your `wezterm.toml`

If you'd like to keep a couple of color schemes handy in your configuration
file, rather than filling out the `[colors]` section, place it in a
`color_schemes` section as shown below; you can then reference it using the
`color_scheme` setting.

Color schemes names that you define in your `wezterm.toml` take precedence
over all other color schemes.

All of the settings available from the `[colors]` section are available
to use in the `color_schemes` sections.

```toml
color_scheme = "Red Scheme"

[color_schemes."Red Scheme"]
background = "red"

[color_schemes."Blue Scheme"]
background = "blue"
```

### Defining a Color Scheme in a separate file

If you'd like to factor your color schemes out into separate files, you
can create a file with a `[colors]` section; take a look at [one of
the available color schemes for an example](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/blob/master/assets/colors/Builtin%20Dark.toml).

You then need to instruct wezterm where to look for your scheme files;
the `color_scheme_dirs` setting specifies a list of directories to
be searched:

```
color_scheme_dirs = ["/some/path/to/my/color/schemes"]
```

Color scheme names that are defined in files in your `color_scheme_dirs` list
take precedence over the built-in color schemes.


### Dynamic Color Escape Sequences

Wezterm supports dynamically changing its color palette via escape sequences.

[The dynamic-colors directory](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/dynamic-colors)
of the color scheme repo contains shell scripts that can change the color
scheme immediately on the fly.  This can be used in your own scripts to alter
the terminal appearance programmatically:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes.git
$ cd iTerm2-Color-Schemes/dynamic-colors
$ for scheme in *.sh ; do ; echo $scheme ; \
   bash "$scheme" ; ../tools/screenshotTable.sh; sleep 0.5; done
```

### Tab Bar Colors

The following options control the appearance of the tab bar:

```toml
[colors.tab_bar]
# The color of the strip that goes along the top of the window
background = "#0b0022"

# The active tab is the one that has focus in the window
[colors.tab_bar.active_tab]
# The color of the background area for the tab
bg_color = "#2b2042"
# The color of the text for the tab
fg_color = "#c0c0c0"

# Specify whether you want "Half", "Normal" or "Bold" intensity for the
# label shown for this tab.
# The default is "Normal"
intensity = "Normal"

# Specify whether you want "None", "Single" or "Double" underline for
# label shown for this tab.
# The default is "None"
underline = "None"

# Specify whether you want the text to be italic (true) or not (false)
# for this tab.  The default is false.
italic = false

# Specify whether you want the text to be rendered with strikethrough (true)
# or not for this tab.  The default is false.
strikethrough = false

# Inactive tabs are the tabs that do not have focus
[colors.tab_bar.inactive_tab]
bg_color = "#1b1032"
fg_color = "#808080"

# The same options that were listed under the `active_tab` section above
# can also be used for `inactive_tab`.

# You can configure some alternate styling when the mouse pointer
# moves over inactive tabs
[colors.tab_bar.inactive_tab_hover]
bg_color = "#3b3052"
fg_color = "#909090"
italic = true

# The same options that were listed under the `active_tab` section above
# can also be used for `inactive_tab_hover`.
```


### Window Padding

You may add padding around the edges of the terminal cells:

```
[window_padding]
left = 2

# This will become the scrollbar width if you have enabled the scrollbar!
right = 2

top = 0
bottom = 0
```
