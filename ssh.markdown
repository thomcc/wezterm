## SSH Connections

wezterm uses libssh2 to provide an integrated SSH client.  The
client can be used to make ad-hoc SSH connections to remote hosts
by invoking the client:

```
$ wezterm ssh wez@my.server
```

(checkout `wezterm ssh -h` for more options).

When invoked in this way, wezterm may prompt you for SSH authentication
and once a connection is established, open a new terminal window with
your requested command, or your shell if you didn't specify one.

Creating a new tab will create a new channel in your existing session
so you won't need to re-authenticate for additional tabs that you
create.

SSH sessions created in this way are non-persistent and all associated
tabs will die if your network connection is interrupted.

Take a look at [the multiplexing section](multiplexing.html) for an
alternative configuration that connects to a remote wezterm instance
and preserves your tabs.
